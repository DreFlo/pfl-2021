## **Strategies**

### **BigNumber**
We used a *data* definition instead of a *type* one since it allowed us to recursively define a new type and to use pattern matching. BigNumber is defined like an inversed list where the "head" would be its last digit to facilitate the algorithms we used.

### **scanner**
Checks and handles whether the argument string represents a positive or negative number. Reverses string to facilitate storing the number in a BigNumber format.

### **output**
Converts a BigNumber into a string by converting its last digit to its representative character and appending that value to the result of a recursive call to output with the rest of the BigNumber. If a number is negative, a '-' is inserted at the beginning.

### **somaBN and subBN**
Add or subtract two BigNumbers using a manual addition/subtraction algorithm. Addition starts by adding their last two digits, if value exceeds 9 then a carry happens to the next digit of the first BigNumber (xs). Subtraction subtracts the last digits of the argument BigNumbers, if the value would be negative carry 10 from the last digit of the first BigNumber (xs). Both construct the result with this value and the result of a recursive call. The functions are complimentary and may call each other to handle negative numbers.

### **mulBN**
Uses a manual multiplication algorithm. Adds the values of a list of simpler multiplications of all permutations of digit pairs between the two BigNumbers with appropriate order of magnitude.

### **divBN**
Follows manual division algorithm. Use the quotient and remainder as accumulators starting at 0. Take the remainder, multiply it by 10 and add the first digit of the dividend, then naively divide (using multiplication) that value by the quotient and store the results appropriately in the accumulators. Execute recursive calls with the remaining digits of the dividend and the quotient until dividend is Empty, then return a quotient and remainder pair.

## **Fibonacci Comparison**

We attempted to calculate the first number where overflow would occur for each type.

### **Int**
We used this code:
``` hs
 head (filter (\(x, y) -> x < 0) (zip (map fibListaInfinita [0::Int .. ]) [0 ..]))
``` 
returning this:
``` hs
(-6246583658587674878,93)
```
Which indicated to us the largest fibonacci number that could be represented as an *Int* was the 92nd, 7540113804746346429.

### **Integer and BigNumber**
We attempted the same with both *Integer* and *BigNumber*, but this time using a timeout of 1 minute because reaching a result was taking too long.
Code:
``` hs
--Integer
timeout (60*10^6) (print (fst (head (filter (\(x, y) -> x < 0) (zip (map fibListaInfinita [0::Integer ..]) [0 ..] )))))

--BigNumber
lista = zeroBN : [last lista `somaBN` oneBN]

x = head (filter (\(x, y) -> not (x `greaterOrEqualsBN` zeroBN)) (zip (map fibListaInfinitaBN lista) [0 ..]))

z = timeout (60*10^6) (print (fst x))
```
We arrived at the conclusion that the largest number both of these types can represent is only limited by the available memory in the computer where they are being stored, allowing them to be arbitrarily large.
