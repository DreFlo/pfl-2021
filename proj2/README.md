# Shi

## Game Description

<p>Shi is a two-player game played in an 8x8 board, each player starting with 8 pieces in a line on opposite sides of the board. The two players' sides are called <em>Ninja</em> and <em>Samurai</em>, the <em>Samurai</em> side always gets the first move of the game.</p>
<p>The goal of the game is to capture the other player's pieces until they only have 4, at which point they will lose. Each piece can move in any direction regardless of the distance as long as there isn't a piece already at the target position. To capture an opponent's piece a player must "jump" over another of their pieces that is colinear with the attacking and target piece and in between them, pieces are only able to jump when attacking.</p>
